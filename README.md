This repository was created for studying.

It concerns the applications in C/C++ I've developed.

The folders "prog_base" and "prog_base_2" relate to Basics of Programming subject.

The folder called "prog_base_3" contains SFML-based "Five card games (Drunkard, Pig, Chicken, 21, Witch)".
It’s a windows application, where you move through menus and play different card games.
You can choose language between Ukrainian and English and read tutorials for every game.
